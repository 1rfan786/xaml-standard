## If you are posting an API for XAML standard consideration:
- Add a brief overview of what you are proposing and why it belongs in XAML Standard (in keeping with the principles of the effort).
- Provide a clear usecase/scenario that describes how this API benefits in sharing cross-platform UI code, preferably a scenario from your experience or application that clearly illustrates why a control/API would benefit from being standardized.
- Add a brief example in XAML syntax for your proposal.
- Provide links to issues/discussions where this proposal has been talked about as well as any other pointer to where this originated or got discussed that could describe the motivation.

For discussions that are not concrete proposals, please prefix title with "Discussion" so we can categorize accordingly.
