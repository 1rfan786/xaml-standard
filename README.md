# XAML Standard

This repository contains the principles and definition of XAML Standard.

XAML Standard is a vocabulary specification that defines a standard XAML vocabulary. Frameworks that support XAML standard can share common XAML based UI definitions. 

The goal is for the first version, XAML Standard 1.0, to be available later this year.  Post specification plans include support of XAML standard in Xamarin.Forms and UWP.

## How to engage, contribute and provide feedback

This spec is being designed in the open. We are in the early stages of defining the spec right now, you can see a draft of XAML Standard 1.0 getting defined [here](docs/v1draft.md). We encourage you to start a discussion or give us direct feedback by [filing an issue](https://github.com/Microsoft/xaml-standard/issues) or [starting a proposal](https://github.com/Microsoft/xaml-standard/labels/proposal). See [proposals-faq](docs/proposalsfaq.md) for more information.
