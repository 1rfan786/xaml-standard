# XAML Standard

This repository contains the principles and definition of XAML Standard.

XAML Standard is a vocabulary spec that defines a standard XAML vocabulary. Frameworks that support XAML standard will be able to share common XAML based UI definitions. At this time, 
- XAML Standard is not a library, rather it is a vocabulary spec
- The goal is to have the first version (XAML standard 1.0) supported in Xamarin Forms, UWP as well as in WPF (.NET Framework).

## How to engage, contribute and provide feedback

This spec is being designed in the open. We are in the early stages of defining the spec right now, you should start seeing details popup in this repository as they get defined. We encourage you to start a discussion or give us direct feedback by [filing an issue](https://github.com/Microsoft/xaml-standard/issues)
